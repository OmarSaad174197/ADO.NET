# ADO.NET
Let`s try ADO.NET using Windows forms with the connected model.
How Does It Work?
- connect with the database with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
- it`s a simple UI WinForms using ADO.NET to make CRUD operations on EmployeesDB.
- You can insert an Employee, update by EmployeeId, delete by EmployeeId, display all the employees in the database, and finally, search for a specific employee by ID.
- implementation in the connected model.
- don`t forget to replace your server name instead of my server name in the connectionString.
  
                                                                      "Happy coding!"
